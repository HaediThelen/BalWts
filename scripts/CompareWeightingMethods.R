# Balaning weights Methods Review

#Libraries

#1. Load and Prepare Data
#1a. label the needed variables 


#2. Estimate IPTW weights
#2a. Fit PS model

#2b. Estimate weights

#2c. Evaluate balance

#2d. Calculate effective sample size


#3. Estimate Balancing Weights
#3a. Prepare data for BalanceR


#3b. Estimate Balancing weights for lambda = 0, 0.5, 1, 2
## process for ATT and save each in a new column

#3c. Evaluate Balance

#3d. Calculate effective sample size for each value of labmda 


#4. Create Balance Plot 
#4a. Prepare a datafram with jsut the balance we need

#4b. Plot


#5. Create Effective Sample size table


#6. Estimate ATT
#6a.Poisson model with IPTWs 

#6b.Poisson model with Balancing weights for each value of lambda
